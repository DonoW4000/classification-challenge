# classification-challenge
in this challenge, I am working at a Internet Service Provider and have been tasked with imporving the email filtering system for its customers. I have been provided with a dataset that contains information about emails, with teo possible classification: spam and not spam. I will take this dataset and develop a supervised machine learning (ML) model that will accurately detect spam emails so it can filter them out of its customers' inboxes. I have created two classification models to fit the data, and evaluated which model is more accurate at detecting spam. The models are a logistic regression model and a random forest model.
